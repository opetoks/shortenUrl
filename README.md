# shortenUrl
This package simply require the user to paste the URL and a short alias to the URL is produced

It's a Neueda Frontend Assignment from vanhack
I actually saw the mail so late i have to quickly do this

# How it Works
The index.php is the frontend where user can parse URLs
random values and a simple short link is formed and append to links.ini file

There are still lot of requirements to finish but my time is limited
